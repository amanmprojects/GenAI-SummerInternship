Previously I had a garmin FR235 and it was great to use it until the battery ran out (approx 3 and a half years of use) . Precisely for this reason I decided that I did not want to invest large sums in these watches, which for the most part the battery will drain in approximately. 3 or 4 years of regular use. For me, the Vivoactive 3 meets everything I need to record my physical activities of running and heart rate. Personally, I don't need to have message notifications or call alerts activated so that my battery lasts longer. I also turn it off when I'm not using the relog. I only turn it on when I am ready to start a physical activity that requires the use of GPS and heart rate. I consider that Garmin offers running watches with very good characteristics, however, the great dilemma of these and any smart technology relog is the duration of the batteries since they cannot be replaced. And this applies to any brand. (some last a little longer others a little less but none lasts what a traditional relog) I hope this evolves or that garmin allows its users to be able to replace their batteries by themselves, of course this does not suit garmin and other manufacturers of Smart watches from important brands, since part of the business is to sell you a smart watch every 3 or 4 years. From all of the above, keep in mind that the battery life of these smart watches late or early will expire (on average 4 years maximum if you use it daily). The Vivoactive does not escape this reality. Many reviews mention that the vivoactive lasts much less than other garmin models, however, in my experience I consider that it is relative since if you put all the options that the relog brings to work, rest assured that the battery is consumed in less days of which ensures the factory before having to connect them to recharge it. For me, for the current price of the vivoactive, it meets my basic needs to record running activities and heart rate, and additionally it looks great elegant and stylish when I take it with me on any stage since I also use it from time to time to go out but when I go out I use another of my traditional watches since the garmin I use it mainly for physical activities so the performance of the useful life of the battery can be extended a little more. but just a little more, no other smart watch that uses rechargeable batteries can escape this reality. Finally, I gave it 4 stars because it is my appreciation for this as well as any other smartwatch that does not allow replacing the batteriesBattery life really depends on the face you want on your watch. If you go with a standard, it’ll last 24/7 for about 5 days for me based on moderately active: swim, walks, and mountain biking.If you elect the face that has widgets such as BPM, a second hand, date, battery, etc. (there’s apps for that on connect IQ) it will reduce your battery life to about 2-3 days 24/7. I wear this while I sleep so keep in mind this is for 72 hours.The GPS is spot on in my opinion and research. I google map, Strava, and my partner has a fit bit, and across the board her fitbit is off. Strava is also a bit off but very close (0.05-0.01 miles) and google and garmin are practically exact.I can’t say the BPM is accurate. It feels off to me, as sometimes i’m 120BPM resting and 2 minutes later i’m at 40BPM. This could be multiple things: watch being loose, widget app being off, etc. I truly think it’s user error for me as I don’t wear the watch tight as I break out in eczema with the silicone wrist band.My Blood pressure is 115/73, im 195lbs, 28 years old, male, and in relatively good shape (10 minute mile jogs). I have no underlying issues and the doc says i’m physically fit. So take my review with this information in mind. This information is extremely relevant to this product. You don’t blame a doctors heart monitor when you visit and this is the same tech, so keep that in mind.i’ve wore this in the ocean while snorkeling with no issues. It works fine in the shower but tends to randomly go through setting depending on how the water hits the face. It works great for weight lifting HOWEVER, I have to consistently manually enter weight and reps as the tech just isn’t there yet. Id say it’s right about 50% of the time. I edit all the info on my phone app. I also use those with an app called Lose It! which is designed to help one lose weight, get the right amount of macronutrients, etc. I’ve lost 25lbs in 2 months through the combination of these two products.The phone I use is an Iphone X (smaller one) so this review might not help the Android user.The product for 150$ is fantastic. Id highly recommend this to anyone willing to be more health conscientious.This watch works very well for its intended purpose. Its nota multi thousand dollar piece of medical monitoring equipment. The heart rate function is not 100 percent accurate, I believe it depends on many variables, how tight or loose the strap is, the angle of your wrist etc. but it gives you a ball park idea and that's as good as it gets. There is an optional chest strap with more accuracy available. the Gps is very accurate and locks in quickly to the satellites. The user interface works good after you learn how to use it, there are lots of menus and it takes a bit to figure out how its all laid out. There is a lock feature that you must use when swimming or showering or the water messes with all your settings, the lock feature could be easier to activate....possibly by providing one more physical button just for locking and unlocking. there are plenty of activity apps provided and you can make a custom one in Garmin Connect if you desire. there are a lot of features that may be useful to some but not others, these can be disabled if not wanted. the watch connects easily with my Android phone and the music controls are very handy. The find your phone feature works great when the grand kids toss the phone under the couch or it slides between the cushions on the couch...love it! Garmin Connect is great lots of graphs and useful information is logged on your activities, and the GPS provides an actual Google map of your run, walk, cycle route or Kayak path. The sleep function has its limitations but provides a general idea of what goes on at night. All in all a very high tech watch that works pretty darn good and provides a good deal of information and fitness motivation.....good job Garmin!","null","FREE delivery Friday, October 7.

I am always very honest in my reviews so I wanted to make sure to try it for a while before writing anything. I started taking 1 tablet and then added a tablet every couple of days so that my body could adjust to it gradually. I am also taking NOW Chlorella as well because I read about how well the products work together. What I do now is I take 2 of each tablet in the morning, 2 at lunch, and 2 before bed.I am in love with these! Within the first few days I noticed an increase in energy and overall better feeling. I've been taking them now for about 3 weeks and my nails are growing faster than I've ever seen. They are also very hard and they look amazing. I am able to eat better because I don't get so many cravings between meals, so I've also noticed that I've lost a few pounds already. I have also noticed that I can focus on things better.You have to make sure to drink a lot of water while taking these. I read about a lot of people have stomach issues while taking these. Let me be honest--during the first week I did and I also broke out on my face a little bit, but after doing research I learned that it sometimes happens while your body is detoxing and flushing toxins out of your body. I am not having these issues anymore now that my body has had some time to get used to both the Spirulina and Chlorella.As for the taste--many people have said they taste gross. They just taste like seaweed to me. I don't mind the taste at all. It's not like I'm chewing the tablets or letting them sit in my mouth forever. I just swallow them with water and I'm fine.Oh yeah, another great thing? This company does not use fillers in the tablets, which I love. The tablets are 100% green with no tiny colored specks so you are getting just the Spirulina. Not alot of other companies can say that.I've gotten my fiance' hooked on these pills as well. He was surprised at how great he felt within a matter of days. They are great for so many health issues and conditions and are worth a try!I've be pre-diabetic 2x and I always take 3000mg daily, morning, noon and night. It keeps my A1C down which is fantastic. This could be a secret doctors are keeping from us..... hmmmmThe best thing about spiralina: you will no longer be able to finish novels in the bathroom.I'm serious. Makes it so quick and easy (but not too much so) you will cut bathroom time to mere minutes.And you won't be working so hard. It's very efficient.So then go finish your reading in a comfortable easy chair.Only thing is, I read that you must take a break from it once in a while. You will notice the difference, trust me!This is a decent brand, no complaints. I will buy the larger size next time. I have no problem swallowing these. It says 2 of them 3 times a day but I find I can get by with less so it lasts a long time.I have also heard than this plus astaxanthin helps you make adult stem cells, so I'm testing that. If so, it's truly a miracle suppliment!I like everything about otI have been taking Spirulina off and on for years, and I love the ""boost"" it gives me,,,I recommend this product!Es un buen producto para complementar tu nutrición sanaExcelente. Reduziu meu apetite, melhorou o funcionamento intestinal. Excelente produto.ÓTIMOVem bem acondicionada.

Very solid product. I have used it for whipping applications and various rapid infusions. Many rapid infusion techniques call for 2-3 cartridges and I have heard inferior brands can fail at these high of pressures. I have had no issues so far, easy to clean, and compatible with the isi rapid infusion kit which makes infusions even easieri find that this is the perfect volume for making espumas, foams, and infusions. While the thermos properties means you cannot externally heat it in a Bain-Marie or Water bath, and the insulation means it needs to be uncapped to be chilled in a fridge, the properties also means you can prepare a hot soup or cold mousse several hours in advance and have it ready to serve without further prep. Thus this feature is a minor double edged feature. The one disappointing feature was that only one of the tips was stainless steel, while the other two are stainless steel threads but plastic tips, as this was not adequately described in the product description. Perhaps the most useful feature about the ISI whips over other brands is the ability to use a large variety of premium attachments, which while not cheap, are very well engineered and work seamlessly. If you plan to do infusions or herb infused foams, the combo ISI Sieve & Funnel are indispensable.ISI is “the“ name in whipped cream maker’s but there are so many models it can be difficult to choose. This is a particularly good one because you can leave it out of the fridge for a few hours at a time. If you have large get-togethers like we do, somebody is probably going to leave this out of the fridge at some point. It’s great if that happens, to know the whip cream is safe.The Thermo Whip is a great product for those who cook or who just enjoy fresh whipped cream. It is designed and manufactured with great precision and quality. Using it is easy and the chargers are easy to obtain. We received ours as a gift and have given several as gifts to others. A great out of the ordinary wedding gift. Based on the quality I expect it will last for many years.I love this so much, I make whipped cream even when there's nothing to put it on. lol It seriously keeps the cream for a lot longer than advertised, there's nothing I don't like about this. It's worth every extra penny to upgrade to this iSi Thermo Whip Plus. LOVE IT!Bought this to replace my previous ISI dispenser which I purchased in 1985. It still works great! Just thought it was time for a new one after 26 years. Boy did I make a mistake. My all white ISI model from 1985 has all metal valves. This one has a plastic valve head with an o-ring on it on the dispenser. Right out of the box, this valve leaked gas when charging. Yes, the decorator tip was attached. The o-ring appeared clean, and, it appeared to close and seal with the decorator tip attached. But I ended up wasting three charges trying to get this to hold a charge, and it leaked every time. So either the o-ring is defective, the spring is defective, or it's just a bad design.Because this is supposed to be the ""for professional use"" model, I feel this is inexcusable. Wasted my time and caused me a lot of frustration.The product does everything advertised and works like a charm. It's even easy to clean. I appreciate that it comes with the cleaning brush and the company has extensive support online.This is the model that is purchased by professional chefs and it's worth the price.Love it, works great. Austrian quality product.Update january2018:Worked great so far but surprisingly discovered rust on the inside bottom of the bottle. Did not think this stainless steel bottle would rust...Yes they are expensive, but the best. Had one in the past that was not thermal and I really like the thermal ones now. Will buy another for hot applications as I want to keep one just for whip cream.It’s expensive but good quality happy with itReally goodEasy to use and enhances a lot of dishes from mains to desserts.Everybody needs an ISI whip, many people just having realised it yet.

They fit perfectly, they require only minimal assembly the first time, they are light, and they look awesome. And if that's not enough to sell you, the sheer number of options for them is amazing. They make storage bags that hang on the doors. They make a solid, black powder coated panel that fits on the outside, effectively turning them into half doors. One popular Jeep parts shop offers an exclusive option -- those same exterior panels, only color matched to your paint! They make mirrors so if you want mirrors, you don't have to keep swapping out the stock ones (the stock mirrors do fit these tube doors if you wish). They even make soft uppers, so together with the exterior panels you can have protection from the elements! The tube doors come with matched locks, and two keys. They're not exactly bulletproof, but they don't need to be. It's not like a lock will do a whole lot of good when you can just hop over the doors.The possibilities are seemingly endless (well, certainly not ""endless"", but my bank account would run out before the options do).One downside to these doors that I've found so far is that there is a little bit of play in the latches after the door is closed. The spring allows the latch to travel just slightly past the point where it grabs. And that's perfectly fine -- except any time you go over a bump that's big enough to overcome the strength of that spring, you'll hear the doors rattle a bit. Not a major problem, but worth mentioning.And then there was one thing that I didn't really expect -- for some reason, people find the tube doors to be WAY cooler than running without doors at all. I've never gotten a comment on the street when running without doors. But in the first 5 minutes of driving with the tube doors (a quick trip to the grocery store and back), I got one ""Nice Jeep!"" yelled at me, one thumbs-up approval, and one honk from a pickup truck (which I assume was intended as a good thing).I will add some additional photos of these doors installed on my 2011 Sport as soon as I can.So here's why I said ""PLEASE read this"" in the title. It's an important bit of information for potential buyers. First, at the time of my purchase the only available photo of the doors had a storage bag and what looked like some soft uppers in the bag. None of that is included in this price. Seems obvious to most, I'm sure. But I just wanted to put it out there.Also, (again, as of this writing) the description states ""Includes optional heavy duty storage pockets that can be positioned either inside the vehcile or outside"". This is also incorrect. It does NOT include the optional storage bags. The storage bags are sold separately, here: Before I start ranting about the negatives let me list the few positives. I was a bit concerned about the latches not lining up correctly but it wasn't the case. The doors do fit perfectly on 2009 JK. They do look impressive and appear to be sturdy and solid. Also, I did not hear any rattling or noises as others have mentioned. There are two major issues that are wrong with them however.1. No matter how careful you are screwing on the latches, you will scratch the heck out of the doors due to metal on metal friction. Personally, I don't care but this is my wife's jeep and she did not appreciate brand new doors getting this messed up. The issue could've been easily resolved by including some sort of weather stripping around the latch and the bracket. You can probably find something in a hardware store to take care of it.2. I've mounted Bestop 51260-01 mirrors on these doors. Unfortunately, the mounting circle of the mirror is too large covering the outside tubing instead of fitting flush against the metal. This is resulting in a gap of about 1/2 inch between the mirror mount and the door. Aesthetically it looks pretty bad but they do appear to be pretty sturdy. Once again, Bestop could've easily fixed the issue by dropping the mounting holes for the mirrors few inches down and to the right. I'll probably do that myself, although not looking forward to drilling through a piece of quarter inch steel.3. When I called Bestop regarding issue #2 I was told to take pictures and email it to their support department. I've done that twice and have yet to get a response.Overall, I'm going to keep the doors and would recommend them assuming you can find a different mirror that works with these doors and cover up the latches to prevent scratches.I purchased a pair of these for my 2 door JK Wranlger (2016). They went on and are overall a great fit.... to clarify on the ""overall"". They line up perfectly with the door hinges. The lock (once installed by the buyer) lines up with the door strike. But the fit stops there. The lock has a signifigant amount of play. The end result is a ton of noise driving down a fairly flat road. Their solution (per the instructions) was to loosen the bolts on the strike for when the tube doors are on and then re-adjust whenever you put your doors back on? REALLY??? My solution was attaching a few 2"" pieces stick-on black weather stripping to act as a buffer between the bar near the lock and the factory door frame. This eliminated the rattle. Much happier with them now. Another gripe is the mirror mounts. The ""cups"" they give you are not deep enough to reuse the factory style mirrors with the factory length bolts. I have a feeling they would be fine with the optional half door skins that are available, but I wanted tube doors with factory style mirrors, not half doors. This just required going to ACE hardware and picking up 4 slightly shorter bolts. Still, overall, very happy with the purchase.Worked great until the first time I locked, then it would not unlock. I had a pai just getting it back off my jeep. Great idea but I like to be able to open my door, I also bought the cargo bags that hook on the doors, now they are all useless unless I can get just the door latch system to replace faulty one. Then I just won’t be able ( or dare)to lock. Just very disappointing that something can fail so quick. Didn’t put on jeep until after Amazon return time was expired. Only buy if you don’t care about locking, and possibly have to climb over to get in and out.","null","FREE delivery Sep 20 - 22. ,FREE delivery Sat, Sep 24,Or fastest delivery Thu, Sep 22.

You'll note that I am using the single rod clamp that attaches to the cage to anchor the matte box. I also installed the full-size HDMI socket bracket as an intermediate connection that will minimize wear on the camera's mini-HDMI port. The balance of the rig using the built-in grip strap (on the away side of the cage in photo) is excellent. Not pictured is the handle which I always use when handheld. It works well in the usual arm-forward shots, low shots, and for carrying - even with the SmallHD 5"" monitor attached. It's not featherweight but it's a lot nicer than my old cages on other cameras.

However in our area we have a really nice rail trail that you can go as far as you want before you decide when you wanna turn around and go back to the car. I wanted to be able to have enough water on hand for me and the dog to safely go long distance. this pack is great it fits well, is adjustable,  it’s lightweight and it held plenty of water in the back.  the two small water bottle held Gatorade which was nice to have.  the front pouches easily hold a small collapsible dog bowl, a whistle, mace and tissues. the water pack was fillable with ice cubes and that was nice because it kept my back cool when I was running. Note the water in the tube gets warm so you need to drink on it a little bit before cold water comes out.  My favorite feature is all 3 bite valves you can pinch with your fingers and squeeze like a cow udder and milk it. basically I could squirt water into the dogs bowl which was fast and convenient and i could get back to jogging quickly.  one thing to note is that it’s kind of noisy running with the pack filled up. all of the clips and straps kind of slap around while you’re running and the water slosh’s around a good bit. obviously as you’re running and drink it, it gets lighter and sloshes around even more.  it was kind of noisy and I could not hear bicycles coming up beside me. that was the only thing I didn’t really like but it’s not the bags fault.  it’s a great bag. I also purchased this bag because the clips on the back will hold my hiking poles which I wanted to be able to have with me as well. And I like safety so bright orange for visibility was important to me. there are a lot of great features packed into this one convenient bag.  I highly recommend it.Update 10-12-2022…it been months now and I still love this water pack.

The injury happened due to over twisting. Wearing this while healing did help me from overusing the muscles. It did become uncomfortable after a few hous a day because of the ongoing pain.Now I am mostly healed, maybe a few more weeks for 99%.So now this will be worn when working, I don't lift heavy stuff so a lifting belt is not necessary, but I do get in ackward positions, this should be very helpful keeping me from over twisting again. Will update after using longer.Not getting any younger but trying to stay that way. Well, that comes with soreness and pain, so take care of it, and get a back brace for lower back pain if you are having any. I do after a long week of lifting stuff and back on the mountain bike I am so sore. This gives you instant relief and allows me to keep going.This is perfect for both men and women, giving you the confidence and back support for lifting and just support. Great for many ailments that keep you behind, get ahead with this adjustable lumbar support belt made with a breathable mesh design and a good size from 31” to 38” you want to measure your waist, so it is right This back brace is for lower back support and the belt features dual adjustment straps to provide customized fit and compression. this back brace will allow you more freedom confidence and support so you can go on and keep enjoying your life without being bothered by lower back pain problems. You’ll notice a difference right away.Bought this for my husband when his back gets aching he puts it on and it supports his backMy husband works part-time at UPS loading trucks~ A Back-brace is required but not supplied~ I decided on this one because its made of a breathable mesh material which has turned out to be very helpful since he works in very warm conditions~The material stretches nicely; so it’s also comfortable for him to wear while being active for long periods of time.He’s been using it regularly for almost 3 months and it’s still in great condition. now that it’s broken in it’s even more comfortable for him.Most importantly it gives him the much needed support and has helped substantially at keeping his back pain from flaring up.I would definitely buy another one of these if need be~ well worth the money!This was purchased for my husband after he did a little research on the various back supports out there. He has a couple of degenerative discs in his lower back. This did the trick. He can now do normal chores, lifting, garden work, etc, without some of the usual discomfort afterwords. The belt fits precisely using the very easily adjustable straps. The pull rings make it that much simpler for proper fit. I wouldn't hesitate referring anybody towards this product. After order received, there was a slight stitching defect. I contacted the supplier directly. They got back to me within a day advising me they were going to send me a new one. I didn't even have to send the original back. Great Customer Service as well.Really helped with my periodic back aches.Great product great price :) so much better than the rubber ones I was using beforeThese booty bands are superb. They really are non-slip so I have been able to use them in my hands, on my feet and ankles and, of course, around my thighs etc. The resistances are noticeable (not that I've worked beyond the lightest one yet) but the stretch is still great so the exercises suggested can be completed even at a beginner level.They come in a handy little bag and are easy to fold back in after each use. The booklet which arrives with them makes some suggestions - although they do not recommend timings/reps. Great value for something which will really impact your home workouts.Since COVID lockdown and my gym being closed I have had to create my own exercise regime with different classes on line.These bands make you work harder at some exercises and help to build muscle strength in arms and thighs and helpt o stop bingo arms and flabby thighs.There are many exercises that you can do and the three bands are different strengths so you can use different ones for arms or legs and also start with on less strong and build up to the stronger one.They are soft and comfortable and don't slide around on my arms or legs when using them.Well packaged.Really prefer this style of band due to the fact they hold some width when stretched, don't pinch to a point like latex bands.These are good strong bands, offering a good thickness. The major benefit of these bands is the non-slip rubber inside, these stop slipping when under tension, they are thick bands and hold on legs wellResistance levels are good for rehab and exercise, overall very good productUseful for home workouts while the gyms are closed during lockdown, to help me keep in shape and not get out of the exercise habit. What’s really useful with these is that they do not take much space at all to store, or even take up a large amount of space while you are working out using these so it’s ideal for anyone. Fairly easy and self explanatory to use, and comfortable to use. 3 included all are different strengths","null","FREE delivery Friday, October 14,Or fastest delivery Sunday, October 9.

As an avid runner, I value a shoe that can provide the necessary support and cushioning for my feet, and the Revel 5 does not disappoint.First and foremost, the fit of these shoes is fantastic. They provide a snug and secure feel without being overly tight. The upper material is breathable, allowing for proper airflow and keeping my feet cool during runs. The shoe also has a padded tongue and collar, adding an extra level of comfort and reducing the risk of chafing or irritation.The cushioning in the Revel 5 is excellent. It offers a balanced mix of responsiveness and impact absorption, ensuring a comfortable and smooth running experience. Whether I'm on pavement, trails, or the treadmill, the shoe provides ample support to my feet, reducing the risk of fatigue or discomfort.One of the standout features of the Revel 5 is its versatility. It performs well on both shorter and longer runs, making it suitable for various distances and training purposes. The shoe also offers good traction, providing reliable grip on different surfaces and weather conditions.Durability is another area where the Revel 5 shines. The construction of the shoe is solid, and it has held up well to regular use and wear. The outsole shows minimal signs of wear, and the upper material has proven to be resistant to abrasion and tearing. This durability gives me confidence that the shoes will last through many miles of running.In terms of style, the Revel 5 has a sleek and modern design. It comes in a variety of color options, allowing for personalization and matching with different running outfits. The reflective accents are a nice touch, providing added visibility and safety when running in low-light conditions.Overall, I highly recommend the Brooks Men's Revel 5 Neutral Running Shoe to anyone in search of a reliable and comfortable running shoe. Its superior fit, cushioning, versatility, and durability make it an excellent choice for runners of all levels. Whether you're training for a race or simply enjoy running as part of your fitness routine, the Revel 5 will provide the support and comfort you need to perform at your best.","[{""asin"":""B08R11X4TL"",""name"":""9.5 Grey/Red""},{""asin"":""B08R12KJ1M"",""name"":""13 Black/Grey/Blue""},{""asin"":""B09FTM65XP"",""name"":""10.5 White/Peacoat/Blue
