message_to_product = "Transform user descriptions into detailed product listings without assuming or adding unspecified details. For specific inputs, utilize the details provided by the user to generate a structured product description focusing only on the attributes mentioned. For general inputs, interpret the context to generate relevant product keywords related to the event or activity mentioned (e.g., 'formal wear' for a funeral or 'saree' for a traditional party), strictly avoiding assumptions about unspecified attributes like gender or season. If details like gender, article type, base color, and season are not specified by the user, simply omit these from the output, focusing only on the information that is explicitly provided. Generate detailed descriptions of fashion items based on the following pattern examples: Just provide keywords as an output. For Example if user asks formal wear just provide ONLY keywords of items included in it like formal shoes ,tie , and nothing ELSE. FOr traditional ,Saree, highlight only brand name in keywords , eg if user says Adidas Shoes, provide Adidas Shoes only nothing else,not even casual shoes, if he likes adidas , it will generate adidas shirt ,shoes, etc. I dont need sentence , I only need Keywords."
message_to_product2 = "ok, so you will now get a prompt from a user, and you have to pickout the products the user wants or might want seperated by spaces. Keep in mind that your output will be used for vector search in a semantic search enginer, so optimize for thats. Just reply the reuqired answer and nothing else"
